This notebook intends to give a very quick introduction to R from a data 
practitioner's point of view. After going through this introduction, you should
be able to differentiate R from other programming languages, so that you can
reason about which tool is best for the job at hand.

# R as a programming language 

## Scripting language 

R is a *scripting language* (as opposed to a *compiled language*). This means
that R code is written as scripts that are run (interpreted) directly from the 
code and in the order that the code is written in. R scripts are simply a 
chronological series of commands.  Other examples of scripting languages are 
JavaScript and Python.

A compiled language, on the other hand, is first compiled into a binary 
which is some lower level language. Before you can run something written in a 
compiled language, you must first compile it. Examples of compiled languages
are C or C++.

Scripting languages are more popular for data because data work involves a 
lot of iteration and trial and error.

## Dynamic typing

R is dynamically typed. This means that variables declared in R can be of 
any type and do not need to be pre-declared. 

```{r}
# First variable x is a number 
x <- 2
# Next variable x is a character string.
# In other languages, this would cause an error
x <- "I am a string"
```

In other languages (and in strict versions of languages such as JS/Python), 
the type need

Dynamic typing is good for iteration and quick feedback. However, it is usually
easier to make mistakes and consumes more memory than other languages.

## Everything is a vector

In some programming languages, there are the concept of *scalars* and *vectors*.
Scalars can only have a length of 1, while vectors are a list of one or more
characters. In R, everything is a vector. 

```{r}
# This may look like we are declaring a scalar, but we can just append
# to it to prove that it is a vector 
x <- 2L
x <- c(x, 1L)
print(x)
```

Many operations in R are *vectorized*, i.e. it is designed to work on vectors.
This is important because while most languages emphasize using `for` loops for 
operating on arrays, R uses vectorized commands and functional constructs
in the `apply` family of functions or in the `purrr` package.

```{r}
# Say you have a vector of integers 
x <- c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L)
# You want to add 3 to each element in the vector
# Non-vectorized (WRONG) way
for (i in 1:length(x)) {
    x[i] <- x[i] + 3L
    print(x)
}
# Vectorized way 
x + 3L
```

## Object-oriented vs Functional

R is primarily a functional language. This means that it uses functions as its
main unit of storing information and logic. Something is that used broadly in 
the R world is the `magrittr` pipe `%>%`, which is very useful for chaining
together functions that produce your desired transformation. This is very
consistently used in the `tidyverse` set of packages, where all of the 
functions usually take a data frame and output another data frame.

```{r}
library(magrittr)
add <- function(x, y) {
    x + y
}
# Non piped way of doing things
x <- 3
x <- add(x, 5)
print(x)
# Piped way of doing things
x <- 3 
x %>% 
    add(5) %>% 
    add(10) %>% 
    add(20) %>% 
    print()
```

R also has various flavors of Object Oriented Programming, but the one I 
can recommend as the most suited to Data Science applications is the `R6` 
class system in the `R6` package.

# R as a computing environment

## The Data Frame 

Whereas most programming languages focus on the primitives (integers, strings,
booleans, etc), the most central form in the R world is the data frame (or the 
`tibble` which is a more advanced data frame used in the `tidyverse`.

A data frame can be described as a list of vectors of equal length and named 
accordingly.

```{r}
library(tibble)
example <- as_tibble(iris)
print(example)
print(example[[1]])
print(example["Sepal.Length"])
print(example["Sepal.Length", 1])
```

## Forms of R code

R code can take many forms:

* A basic R script that contains commands that you can run. You can use 
  `source('path/to/R/script')` within R to run an R script. You can also 
  use `Rscript path/to/R/script` in the command line; which is useful when 
  running scripts in production or in Docker containers.
* In an R markdown document or R Notebook that allows you to mix code and prose
  and be able to "knit" that document into an HTML or other format. This format
  is ideal for various applications.
* In an R package where you write functions and other reusable pieces of code.
  If you are going to write R code for repeated use, it is ideal to use a 
  package format.
* Special forms such as a Plumber API or a Shiny app that form the basis of 
  an application that you can run on a long standing basis to serve customers.
  This is used when building lasting infrastructure for use on a regular basis.

## Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)

R packages can be created locally and installed locally, but the most popular
way that people share and consume R packages is through CRAN. CRAN is maintained
by volunteers and the R Foundation, and they ensure that every package submitted
to CRAN is tested and that dependencies of packages on each other (also known as 
reverse dependencies) do not break.

CRAN is a big reason why it is very easy to find, install, and use R packages.
Because of the reverse dependencies checks, we can upgrade our package versions
with relative ease and not be scared of changes.

An alternative to CRAN is MRAN (Microsoft), which allows us to snapshot packages
at a particular point in time, so that our dependencies don't break over time. 
MRAN is used in `rocker` Docker images because they allow us to freeze 
package versions at a certain point in time

## The Tidyverse set of packages 

The tidyverse is a set of packages that work well with each other. It is also
a package in itself.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

The most important packages in the tidyverse are:

* `readr` - Reading and writing from flat files 
* `tidyr` - Tidying your data into a tidy format 
* `purrr` - Functional programming in R 
* `dplyr` - Bread and butter data frame manipulation
* `ggplot2` - Visualization using the grammar of graphics
* `stringr` - For text manipulation

Knowing just all 6 of these packages by heart will allow you to cover a vast 
majority of data analysis use cases.

## The Tidy Data Science Process

## Pointers

* **Use R projects!** It is important, especially as you use version control,
  that you always encapsulate your work in an R project. This ensures that your
  working directory is always in the same place, and that you can easily 
  do git commands within Rstudio.
* **Code is real, data is not** You usually do _not_ commit data files into your 
  version control, but rather, your scripts should always have the ability to 
  regenerate whatever data manipulations you have done. This means that if 
  you have data, you usually do not modify that data in place and record any 
  modifications you have made to that data in R scripts.
* **Do not repeat yourself**. If you copy and paste a piece of code, use a 
  function. If you copy and paste a function, write a package.
* **Don't reinvent the wheel**. There will almost always be a package that makes
  whatever task you want to do a lot easier. Do your research before deciding
  to write code. 

## Workflow Packages 

* `usethis` and `devtools` - for package development 
* `golem` - for shiny app development 
* `here`  - for working directory management 
* `drake` - for caching and managing analytic projects 

# R resources 

* Hands down the best book for learning R for Data Science is 
  [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html). It is available for 
  free at this link.
* Use [RSeek](https://rseek.org/) when searching for anything R related, because
  R as a letter is hard to search.
* Subscribe to [R weekly](http://rweekly.org/) for a weekly newsletter on the 
  latest and greatest in R. 
* [RStudio's resources page](http://resources.rstudio.com/) are among the best
